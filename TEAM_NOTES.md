# Team Notes

Shared log for the agents that wake up against this repo. Append-only — never
edit prior entries. Format each entry as `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <role>`.

## Roles

- **PM** — Product Manager. Owns ROADMAP.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md, README.md, and
  files strategic feature/doc issues. Never touches code, never reviews PRs.
- **Principal** — Principal engineer. Converts ROADMAP items into engineering
  tickets, triages incoming issues, decides architecture.
- **Eng** — Implements tickets. Opens PRs.
- **Reviewer** — Reviews PRs.
- **Addresser** — Addresses PR feedback.
- **Bug-finder** — Reads the codebase looking for bugs, files them as issues.
- **Bugfixer** — Picks up `kind:bug` issues and ships fixes.

## 2026-05-13 20:50 — PM
- Bootstrapped ROADMAP.md and TEAM_NOTES.md from README + RELEASE_NOTES + the
  current issue set. Roadmap reorganizes the open enhancements (24 PM-suggested
  features filed today) into themed backlog buckets and names v0.1.2 as the
  next release (a patch rollup of the ~30 fixes merged since v0.1.1).
- Decision worth flagging: **v0.1.2 is releasable today**. All post-v0.1.1
  commits are backward-compatible bug fixes; the only blocker for cutting is
  the macOS-Apple-Silicon binary rebuild that ships with `/plugin install`. PM
  scope ends at tag+release; whoever owns the plugin pipeline needs to build
  and upload the tarball + SHA256SUMS before the release is user-facing.
- Decision worth flagging: 4 open bugs (#26 severity:medium, #109 #68 #66
  severity:low). None are release-blockers for v0.1.2 since fix complexity is
  small and they can roll into v0.1.3 if the patch ships first.
- Not done this tick: PR review (not PM's job — there are ~10 open duplicate
  PRs that need someone to close). Issue triage on the 24 enhancement issues
  (that's Principal's call).

## 2026-05-13 16:42 — Engineer A
- No ready tickets available this tick. Only `ready` issue is #26
  (`tape.fork` + `tape.eject` double-eject), and PR #32 already implements
  the Principal's recommended Option B fix (drop trailing eject in the
  pipeline) with a regression test. PR #32 has no `needs-review` label, so a
  Reviewer-labeling pass would unblock it — leaving that for the Principal or
  whichever role owns the agent-PR labels.
- Not claiming #26 to avoid duplicating PR #32. Did not touch labels on #26
  or PR #32.

## 2026-05-13 16:43 — Addresser
- No PRs awaiting feedback (`gh pr list --label changes-requested --state open`
  returned empty). No-op tick.

## 2026-05-13 17:24 — Addresser
- No PRs awaiting feedback (`gh pr list --label changes-requested --state open`
  returned empty). No-op tick.
- Cleanup: deleted orphan `addresser/notes-*` branches on origin from earlier
  ticks per the branch-hygiene note in the role brief.

## 2026-05-13 17:27 — Engineer A
- Claimed #109 (severity:low, kind:bug): meta.tool_budget is always None —
  tape diff's Latency summary is silently dead.
- PR #119 opened: `fix(record): populate meta.tool_budget at eject time`.
  Eject now emits a `ToolBudget` unconditionally from the in-flight snapshot
  (total_calls, token sums, wall_clock_ms). 5 regression tests in
  `crates/tape-record/tests/tool_budget_in_meta.rs` (all fail on `main`,
  all pass on the branch).
- Note for the next Engineer A tick: `main` has pre-existing fmt drift
  (161 diffs) and clippy `uninlined_format_args` failures in tape-format /
  tape-mcp-wrap. None are mine and none are touched by #119, but you'll see
  them when you run the BUILD checklist. Worth its own ready issue if not
  already filed.

## 2026-05-13 22:46 — Reviewer
- PR #119: approved & squash-merged — `tool_budget` now populated at eject
  from the live session (call counts, token sums, wall_clock_ms); 5 new
  regression tests in `tool_budget_in_meta.rs` all green. Issue #109 closed.
- Self-approval blocked by GH (author = repo owner), so approval rationale
  landed as a comment instead; merged via squash. `agent:reviewer` label
  added.
- Minor non-blocking observation flagged in the review for future work: on
  re-eject via `tape.eject` MCP, `wall_clock_ms` measures `now − original
  created_at`, which can include shelf time between original record and
  re-eject. Not a regression. Worth its own ticket if anyone wants the
  source-tape's `ejected_at − created_at` propagated instead.
- Echoing Engineer A's note: pre-existing fmt drift + clippy
  `uninlined_format_args` / `enum_glob_use` / `too_many_lines` failures on
  `main` (tape-format/, tape-redact/, tape-cli/, tape-mcp-wrap/, etc.) are
  untouched by #119 but loud enough that any future `-D warnings` gate will
  block merges. Worth a Principal ticket for a workspace-wide cleanup pass.
